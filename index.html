        Hello! Thanks for visiting my webpage. I am a fifth year PhD student attached to the <a href="https://ee.iitkgp.ac.in/">Electrical Engineering Department, Indian Insitute of Technology, Kharagpur</a>. I am extremely fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://facweb.iitkgp.ac.in/~ahota/index.html">Prof. Ashish R. Hota</a>. Prior to my graduation, I was attached to the <a href="https://jadavpuruniversity.in/academics/electrical-engineering/">Electrical Engineering Department, Jadavpur University</a>, where I also served as a visiting faculty, after completing my Masters in Electrical Engineering, with a specialization in Control Systems. <br><br><br>
        I am fortunate to have worked in collaboration with great researchers, such as, <a href="https://www.egr.msu.edu/~vaibhav/">Prof. Vaibhav Srivastava</a> (Michigan State University), <a href="https://www.bsaver.io/">Dr. Saverio Bolognani</a> and <a href="https://www.elokda.info/">Dr. Ezzat Elokda</a> (ETH Zurich), <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/philpare">Prof. Philip E. Pare</a> (Purdue University), <a href="https://hero.engin.umich.edu/">Prof. Alfred O. Hero</a> (University of Michigan), and <a href="https://www.aero.iitb.ac.in/home/people/faculty/rohit">Prof. Rohit Gupta</a> (IIT Bombay).
        Beyond game theory and epidemics in specific (and spreading process in general), I am also interested in exploring new problems relating to safe-control, security breach in cyber-physical systems, and reinforcement-learning based problems.
        Given that I am in my final year of graduation, I am also searching for Postdoc positions. If you find me an appropriate candidate, I will be happy to discuss further. <br>

        <h2 class="section-title" id="researchques">Research Interests</h2>
      <ul>
        My research area during graduation is focussed primarily on game-theoretic treatments within the framework of epidemiological settings. To address certain research gaps and solve some of the critical problems that arises during a pandemic, I have adopted the following methodologies:
        <br><br>
        <li>By modeling forward-looking individuals, and applying <strong>Dynamic Population Game Theory</strong>, I have characterized the Nash strategies, and obtained the optimal policies for various parameter regimes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Due to presence of asymptomatic agents, individuals are unaware of their infection status, resulting in smart phone applications (e.g., Aarogya Setu App) providing noisy information about the state. By posing the information design problem within the lens of <strong>Bayesian Persuasion</strong>, I have obtained the optimal signaling schemes of the sender that minimize infection level.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Mutating strains </strong> (such as Omicron, Delta etc.) induce high uncertainty in the dynamics of epidemics, and hence arresting infection spread becomes extremely demanding for policy-makers. I am currently investigating the impact of human decision-making on epidemic evolution when the strains undergo mutation processes</li>
        
        
        
        
        <!--I have worked on the containment of the spread of infectious diseases during a pandemic, by integrating epidemiological mathematical models with human decision-making.
        To this end, I have considered a large population of decision-makers, in which the individuals are modeled to be non-myopic agents. Most of the prior works have mainly modeled the decision-makers to be myopic, who consider only instantaneous rewards while choosing their actions. 
        However, in reality the picture is quite different, and individuals take into account the future rewards while making decisions. For instance, people choose vaccination as their strategy even though the immediate cost is high, but it protects them from getting infected in the long-run. By modeling individuals as forward-looking, and applying <strong>Dynamic Population Game Theory</strong>, I have characterized the Nash strategies, and obtained the optimal policies for various parameter regimes.<br>
        <br>
        I have also considered a partial information based environment, in which agents are unaware of their exact infection status. The environment of unawareness arises from the presence of asymptomatic agents. The influence of information in epidemic games is a relatively unexplored area. The recent COVID-19 saw the emergence of several smart phone applications (e.g., Aarogya Setu App), in the form of symptom-checker apps, that provide noisy information about the infection status of an individual.
        I have posed this structure within the framework of framework of <strong>Bayesian Persuasion</strong>, in which the receivers (possesing Bayesian rationality) rely upon signals that the sender disseminates. Based on these signals and the prior, receivers form a posterior belief of their infection status.
        My analysis shows that it is possible to reduce infection by changing the signaling schemes, and therefore, have obtained the optimal signaling schemes of the sender that minimize infection level.
        In addition, I have also been involved in learning-based control, and have developed skills in using optimal control solvers (such as the QuITO, BOCOP etc.) to solve finite-time horizon optimal control problems of complex dynamical systems, in a direct manner.<br>
        <br><br>
        The primary questions answered are as follows.
        <br><br>
        <li>What are the Nash strategies chosen by the forward looking individuals in a large population under different parameter regimes, and how they influence the spread of epidemics?</li>
        <li>In what way does lockdown strategies imposed on recovered individuals influences the peak infection level?</li>
        <li>What is the role of information in epidemic games, when individuals are unaware of their infection status?</li>
        <li>Can we reduce infection prevelance simply by modulating the information transmitted to individuals having partial knowledge about their state? If so, what is the optimal signal sent to minimize infection spread?</li>-->
        
      </ul>

        The illustration on the left shows that due to overlap of symptoms of the infectious disease with other common diseases, and due to the presence of asymptomatic agents, individuals are unaware of their exact infection status. 
        COVID-19 saw the emergence of several smart phone applications, developed in the form of symptom checker apps, which provided certain noisy information to the users. The question answered is what is the optimal information that should be transmitted to minimize infection level.
        <br>

      <br><br><br><br><br><br>
        The picture on the left shows that individuals are usual non-myopic decision-makers, who choose their instantaneous actions based on their future rewards. This is seen in the form of people opting for vaccinations, i.e., even though the immediate cost is high, vaccinations protect individuals from getting infected in the long-run.
        By modeling non-myopic decision-makers, the objective is to obtain the optimal policies of such agents, considering a Markov Decision Process.
