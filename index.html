        Hello! Thanks for visiting my webpage. I am a fifth year research scholar attached to the Electrical Engineering Department at Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. I am fortunate to have been advised by Prof. Ashish R. Hota. Prior to my graduation, I was attached to the Electrical Engineering Department at Jadavpur University, where I also served as a visiting faculty, after completing my Masters in Electrical Engineering, with a specialization in Control Systems. <br> 
        My research area during graduation is focussed primarily on game-theoretic treatments within the framework of epidemiological settings. I have worked on the containment of the spread of infectious diseases during a pandemic, by integrating epidemiological mathematical models with human decision-making.
        To this end, I have considered a large population of decision-makers, in which the individuals are modeled to be non-myopic agents. By applying <strong>Dynamic Population Game</strong>, the optimal policies are determined.<br>
        In addition, I have also considered a partial information based environment, in which agents are unaware of their exact infection status. They rely upon signals that the sender disseminates.
        This problem has been solved within the framework of <strong>Bayesian Persuasion</strong>, to obtain the optimal signaling schemes of the sender to minimize infection level. I have also been involved in learning-based control, and have developed skills in using optimal control solvers (such as the QuITO, BOCOP etc.) to solve finite-time horizon optimal control problems of complex dynamical systems, in a direct manner.<br>
        I am fortunate to have worked in collaboration with great researchers from <strong>Michigan State University, ETH Zurich, Purdue University, University of Michigan, IIT Bombay</strong>. I expect to witness such similar collaborations as I transit from a graduate student to an independent researcher. Beyond game theory and epidemics in specific (and spreading process in general), I am also interested in exploring new problems relating to safe-control, security breach in cyber-physical systems, and reinforcement-learning based problems.
        Given that I am in my final year of graduation, I am also searching for Postdoc positions. If you find me an appropriate candidate, I will be happy to discuss further. <br>

        The picture shows that due to overlap of symptoms of the infectious disease with other common diseases, and due to the presence of asymptomatic agents, individuals are unaware of their exact infection status. 
        COVID-19 saw the emergence of several smart phone applications, developed in the form of symptom checker apps, which provided certain noisy information to the users. The question answered is what is the optimal information that should be transmitted to minimize infection level.

        This picture shows that individuals are usual non-myopic decision-makers, who choose their instantaneous actions based on their future rewards. This is seen in the form of people opting for vaccinations, i.e., even though their immediate cost is high, it protects individuals from getting infected in the long-run.
        By modeling non-myopic decision-makers, the objective is to obtain the optimal policies of such agents, considering a Markov Decision Process.
